# Co-op platform: register interest


# Co-op prototyping kit proof of concept

This is a proof of concept for a simple prototyping kit.

The aim is to enable anyone with a text editor to create simple Co-op branded
prototypes quickly and without the need for technical knowledge or to install
complex software such as Node or Ruby.

*Note: This README file is not intended for the end-users of the kit. It is
here for the folks who will be working on the kit, to explain how it
works/will work. The version of the kit that will be downloadable to users
will not include this file.*

## Using the prototyping kit

To use the prototype kit, users will
[download it](https://github.com/coopdigital/prototype-kit-proof-of-concept/releases/download/0.1.0/prototype-kit.zip)
and open the GETTING-STARTED.html file on their computer.

## Principles

The prototype kit:

  * is designed for prototyping, not for production code
  * requires minimal skills to get started: HTML and CSS
  * requires minimal software to use: a text editor and a browser
